# OpenHive

**Open-source team messaging platform** — a real-time team messaging app anyone can self-host in minutes.

OpenHive is a community-driven project built with Next.js and Supabase. The goal: build a full-featured, beautiful team communication platform that's **100% open-source** and easy to deploy. No vendor lock-in, no hidden costs — bring your own Supabase instance and you're good to go.

> **We're looking for contributors!** Whether you're a frontend developer, designer, or backend engineer — there's room for everyone. See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** (or pnpm/yarn)
- A **Supabase** account (free tier works fine) — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arseneHuot/openhive.git
cd openhive
npm install
```

### 2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you'll see the **setup wizard**.

### 3. Connect your Supabase project

The setup wizard will guide you through connecting your own Supabase instance:

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Settings > API** in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**
4. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens** and generate a **Personal Access Token** (starts with `sbp_...`)
5. Enter all three values in the setup wizard

The wizard will:
- Validate your credentials
- **Auto-provision all 23 database tables**, RLS policies, triggers, and functions
- Enable Realtime on the required tables
- In dev mode: write your config to `.env.local` (gitignored, never committed)
- In production: display the env vars to copy into your hosting platform

> **Note:** The Personal Access Token is used **once** during provisioning and is **never stored**.

### 4. Restart and sign up

**Local development:** After provisioning, restart the dev server (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`), create an account, and start chatting!

**Production (Vercel, etc.):** The wizard will show the env vars to set — see [Deployment](#deployment) below.

---

## Configuring Video Calls (LiveKit)

Video/audio calls are powered by [LiveKit](https://livekit.io), an open-source WebRTC platform. This is **optional** — messaging works without it.

### Option A: LiveKit Cloud (easiest)

1. Sign up at [cloud.livekit.io](https://cloud.livekit.io) (free tier available)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your **Server URL**, **API Key**, and **API Secret**

### Option B: Self-hosted LiveKit

1. Follow the [LiveKit self-hosting guide](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/local/)
2. Use your self-hosted server URL and generated API credentials

### Enable calls in OpenHive

1. Open your workspace in OpenHive
2. Click the workspace name (top-left) > **Workspace Settings**
3. Scroll to **Video Calls (LiveKit)**
4. Enter your LiveKit **Server URL**, **API Key**, and **API Secret**
5. Check **"Enable calls for this workspace"**
6. Click **Save**

That's it! The phone icon will appear in channel headers and DM conversations. If LiveKit is not configured, users will see a helpful dialog explaining how to set it up.

## Database Schema

OpenHive auto-provisions **23+ tables** with full RLS (Row Level Security):

**Core:**
`profiles` · `workspaces` · `workspace_members` · `channels` · `channel_members` · `messages` · `reactions` · `file_attachments` · `pins` · `read_receipts`

**Calls & Presence:**
`workspace_settings` · `active_calls` · `call_participants`

**Integrations:**
`incoming_webhooks` · `outgoing_webhooks` · `webhook_delivery_logs` · `bots` · `bot_channel_memberships` · `bot_event_subscriptions` · `slash_commands`

**Extended:**
`reminders` · `shared_channel_links` · `remote_profiles` · `saved_items` · `scheduled_messages`

All migrations are in `src/lib/supabase/migrations.ts` — the setup wizard runs them automatically.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

1. **Run locally** first: `npm run dev` → complete the setup wizard to provision your database
2. Push your code to GitHub
3. Import the repo in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon key
   - `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` — server-side LiveKit credentials for calls
   - `LIVEKIT_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ID` — workspace allowed to use those LiveKit credentials
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_SERVER_CONFIGURED=true` — tells the call UI LiveKit is configured
5. Deploy!

The setup wizard and provisioning endpoint are disabled in production. Provision locally before deploying, and never commit `.env.local` or API secrets. The service-role key is intentionally omitted from this deployment; the invite and upload routes need further security work before enabling it.

#### Configure Supabase Site URL (important for email invitations)

After deploying, update your Supabase project so invitation and password-reset emails point to your production domain (not `localhost`):

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL** to your production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
3. Add your production URL and any local development URL you use to the **Redirect URLs** list

Without this step, invitation emails will contain `localhost` links that won't work for your users.

#### Configure a custom SMTP (recommended)

Supabase's built-in email service has strict rate limits (3–4 emails/hour on the free plan). For production, set up a custom SMTP provider so invitations and password resets are delivered reliably:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Project Settings** → **Authentication** → **SMTP Settings**
2. Enable **Custom SMTP**
3. Enter your SMTP credentials

**Recommended provider:** [Resend](https://resend.com) — generous free tier (3 000 emails/month), simple setup, and works great with Supabase. Other options: SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, Postmark.

> **Without a custom SMTP**, Supabase uses its default email service which is rate-limited and emails may land in spam. Setting up a proper SMTP provider ensures your team's invitation and password reset emails are delivered instantly.

### Other platforms

OpenHive runs anywhere Node.js runs — Railway, Fly.io, Docker, AWS, etc.

1. Provision the database locally with the setup wizard
2. Set the required environment variables on the hosting platform
3. Deploy

For a local production build, run `npm run build && npm start` after provisioning.
